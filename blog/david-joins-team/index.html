<p>We welcome David Holmberg who recently started as a PhD Student in our group! David will work in the <a href="https://pharmb.io/project/autonomous-phenomics/">Autonomous Phenomics project</a>.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-your-education-and-what-have-you-done-earlier-in-your-career">What is your education, and what have you done earlier in your career?</h4>

<p>Alright, so I am a graduate from Lund University - Faculty of Engineering (LTH) where I got myself a Master of Science in Engineering Nanoscience degree. I chose to specialize in essentially Bioinformatics and Applied Biophysics, which has given me a fairly broad background including some classical hardware, physics, and automation in addition to the biomedical, biotechnological, and Bioinformatics I&rsquo;ve chosen to specialize in.<br />
The best part of the entire programme was my thesis project, where I used Machine-learning to classify <em>active</em> neurons simply from the shape of their signal-waveforms. I later used these classified neurons to evaluate two distinct genotypes from each-other, and to evaluate the effect a new compound had on these neurons based on their activity over time.<br />
Right before I graduated I took a stint as an image-analyst and electron microscope operator at a Lund-based nano-wire production company called Sol-Voltaics.<br />
<br></p>

<h4 id="what-is-your-phd-project-about">What is your PhD-Project about?</h4>

<p>In a way, my PhD-project is a logical next step from my masters; I will be using Deep-Learning to classify and profile living cells based on their morphological features and how these change over time. The Idea is that by using Deep-Learning software for this, we can increase the analytical through-put and thus increasing efficiency of pharmaceutical development and base-research.<br />
For those unfamiliar with Deep-Learning (which in itself is a subset of <em>Machine-Learning</em>), it is the art building self-modifying software that mimic the data-processing architecture of brains. For this particular case, I will be working with a class of deep-learning software called Convolutional Neural Networks (or CNNs for short). These are designed to mimic the way the visual cortex process spatial information, and are very good for image analysis.<br />
CNNs are a very powerful tool, especially when combining it with graphics accelerators which are purpose built to process dimensional operations. However, some caution is still needed. As these are very powerful self-teaching networks, we have to be very careful about how we preprocess and select the data that&rsquo;s fed into the machine to teach it, else we really have no idea what it&rsquo;s <em>actually</em> doing.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-hope-to-achieve-during-your-stint-at-the-pharmaceutical-bioinformatics-group">What do you hope to achieve during your stint at the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics Group?</h4>

<p>I want to continue evolving my mastery at developing cool and efficient AI-tools for complex problems. No, really, I really want to work with cool cutting edge AI-technology. I&rsquo;ve frankly wanted to do that since I first heard of AI in a sci-fi show! With age and education that&rsquo;s been tempered from wanting to build R2D2 into developing novel and efficient tools for everything from BMIs to diagnostics. Now I have an amazing chance to work on cutting-edge profiling tools for a very real problem with an amazing group of people!</p>

<h4 id="do-you-have-any-hidden-talents">Do you have any hidden talents?</h4>

<p>Right. Well&hellip; I am a pretty capable pit-master and chef, and I have had an inquisitive and curious approach to cooking for a long time now. I am also a very capable mead-brewer, and have been brewing my own honey-wines for almost 14 years now. Yes, I made my first honey-wine at 15! I have also brewed a few other types of alcoholic beverages including cidres, fruit-wines, and beers, though mead remains my best produce.</p>
