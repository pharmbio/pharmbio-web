Bioclipse is a free and open source workbench for the life sciences.  Bioclipse
is based on the [Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP)](http://eclipse.org/rcp/)
which means that Bioclipse inherits a state-of-the-art plugin architecture,
functionality, and visual interfaces from Eclipse, such as help system,
software updates, preferences, cross-platform deployment etc.

Bioclipse development has been discontinued, and the project is no longer maintained.
