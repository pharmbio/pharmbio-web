We are looking for a skilled Data Engineer to join our team!

## Tasks
In collaboration with other researchers, develop, implement and test systems for AI-controlled automated microscopes. The task includes interacting directly with the microscope and establishing pipelines where models trained on previously taken images decide and control where the microscope should take images in the next step to reach a specific goal. We are looking for a candidate with a genuine interest in technology and automation, and who enjoys solving problems including both practical interaction with hardware (robots, microscopes) and different types of software. Since our microscopes generate large amounts of images, the position will also include large-scale data management and -analysis. You will work with researchers in AI modeling and biological laboratory sciences, and contribute to implementing methods and evaluating them for different types of biological problems.


This is a 2-year position that is part of the HASTE project, funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) aiming at developing new, intelligent ways of processing and managing very large amounts of microscopy images in order to be able to leverage the imminent explosion of image data from modern experimental setups in the biosciences. Industry collaborators are Vironova AB and AstraZeneca AB. More information about the HASTE project is available at http://haste.research.it.uu.se


## Qualifications
A master's degree in engineering or a university degree in a relevant field is a requirement. Good programming skills in Python and preferably more programming languages is a requirement. Experience in AI modeling, Linux systems as well as developing REST services and APIs is a requirement. Experience of AI modeling on image data, practical handling of automated microscopes and working with software containers (e.g. Docker/Singularity) is meriting.
