Funded by an infrastructure grant from the Swedish Research Council, our research group at Uppsala University is now establishing a new node as part of the [Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden](https://www.cbcs.se), a national infrastructure for chemical biology. Our facility node will offer services focused on cell profiling and screening primarily using the [Cell Painting](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.105) assay.

The positions are placed at the Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences located at the Biomedical Center (BMC), Uppsala University, where you will work closely with a team of biologists, data scientists, and engineers in close collaboration to the [Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics](https://pharmb.io/) research group. 

## Position 1: Biomedical Analyst (BMA) with a focus on chemical biology and image-based cell profiling
We are looking for an experienced biomedical analyst (BMA) for a permanent position as technical staff in the facility to work with morphological profiling services and small molecule screening.

**Qualifications:** University degree in a relevant field. More than five years of laboratory experience, including cell culture, molecular biology techniques such as immunofluorescence staining, cell-based assay development and optimization of lab protocols. Laboratory automation experience and an ability to troubleshoot high throughput equipment including robotic liquid handlers.

## Position 2: 1st Research Engineer with a focus on chemical biology and image-based cell profiling
We are looking for an experienced 1st Research Engineer for a permanent position as technical staff in the facility to work with morphological profiling services and small molecule screening.

**Qualifications:** Doctoral degree in a relevant field. More than five years of laboratory experience, including cell culture, molecular biology techniques such as immunofluorescence staining, cell-based assay development and optimization of lab protocols. Laboratory automation experience and an ability to troubleshoot high throughput equipment including robotic liquid handlers.

## Position 3: Researcher with a focus on morphological cell profiling (1-year temporary position)
We are looking for an experienced Researcher for a 1-year temporary position in our team to work on establishing Cell Painting (high-content imaging of cells using multiplexed fluorescent dyes) as a methodology that can be offered as a service to Swedish researchers. Tasks include: Standardization of Cell Painting in diverse cell models including cancer cell lines and primary cells; Development of cell-line specific image analysis pipelines; Generation of reference datasets for selected drug libraries; Interaction with the rest of the team to establish the necessary lab infrastructure, protocols, and data analysis required for a service facility.

**Qualifications:** Doctoral degree ina a relevant field. Solid experience in cell-based experimentation and molecular biology techniques such as immunofluorescence staining, cell-based assay development and lab protocol optimization. Experience of laboratory automation including robotized liquid handling as well as the use of automated microscopy and image analysis is a requirement. Experience from profiling and screening of chemicals / drugs and the Cell Profiler software is meriting.
