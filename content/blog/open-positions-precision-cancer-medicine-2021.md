After being awarded 2 grants from the Swedish Research Council, we are now strengthening our team to work towards autonomous phenomics and precision cancer medicine.For more information about the project and research group, see https://pharmb.io/project/autonomous-phenomics/. The precision cancer medicine applications are carried out as a collaboration with the Kallioniemi group (https://ki.se/en/onkpat/olli-kallioniemis-group) at Karolinska Institutet.

## Position 1: PhD Student in Pharmaceutical Science with a focus on automated phenotypic drug profiling

We are currently looking for an ambitious and highly motivated PhD student with a good background in cell biology as well as interest in molecular biology, high-throughput screening and bioinformatics. The position includes both laboratory experiments using our robotized cell profiling laboratory, and data analysis of primarily images from high-content imaging of cells. The successful candidate will join an active and interdisciplinary team of researchers, and participate in a project to build up an intelligent, automated laboratory for cell profiling, with applications in precision cancer medicine. 

<b>Qualifications:</b> The highly motivated candidate should have a MSc in cell/molecular biology/biotechnology or equivalent field and previous laboratory experience. Familiarity with standard lab techniques is required, including:
: Cell culture of cancer cells and other cellular models, including primary cells
: Molecular biology, including among others western blotting, CRISPR/Cas9, cloning, siRNA and DNA transfections, RNA/DNA extraction, PCR and quantitative real-time PCR techniques
:	Cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis assays.
:	Immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation techniques.
:	Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
:	Liquid handling and automation
:	Fluorescent microscopy imaging

Experience with data analysis and image analysis is meriting, and the candidate should be highly interested to learn/deepen the competence to automate lab operations with robotics and scripting. The candidate should have excellent communication skills and be keen on actively interacting with other team members including biologists, software engineers, and researchers in AI/ML. Excellent skills in oral and written English are required, as well as the ability to work both independently and as part of a highly interdisciplinary team.

## Position 2: PhD student in pharmaceutical bioinformatics with a focus on analysis of high-content imaging with AI

We are currently looking for an ambitious, highly motivated PhD student with a solid background in data science and AI, to join our research group. The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team of researchers and participate in a project to build up an intelligent, automated laboratory for cell profiling, with applications in systems medicine. The focus of the project is to develop and apply methods for analyzing images from large-scale high-content imaging experiments such as drug screening. This includes image analysis such as cell segmentation, calculation of morphological features, unsupervised and supervised learning (AI/ML) including deep learning on image-based data. 

<b>Qualifications:</b> The highly motivated candidate should have a MSc in science, data science, bioinformatics, or equivalent field. Documented experience in data science, python programming, image analysis and experience from working on linux-systems is a requirement. AI/ML-modeling with methods such as deep neural networks trained on image data is a requirement. Previous experience of image analysis of cells, specifically using high-throughput and high-content microscopy imaging, is meriting.
The candidate should have excellent communication skills and be keen on actively interacting with other team members including biologists, software engineers, and researchers in AI/ML. You are able to take instructions but also work independently to carry out analysis on your own. Excellent skills in oral and written English are required.
