**Welcome to the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group at Uppsala University**

Principal Investigator: [Ola Spjuth](https://pharmb.io/people/olas/)

Research focus: Data-intensive and translational bioinformatics
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group focuses on mathematical and statistical modeling, informatics and quantitative analysis of pharmacological systems. We develop methods, algorithms and software to study and model pharmaceutical interactions, and a key focus in the group is how predictive modeling, large-scale calculations and modern e-infrastructure (such as high-performance and cloud computing) can aid the drug discovery process; e.g. when studying drug toxicity, metabolism and resistance. We are involved in several national and international consortia and have a tight connection to the pharmaceutical industry, Uppsala University Hospital, and Science for Life Laboratory. See the [Projects](https://pharmb.io/project/) page for more information on our ongoing research projects.
