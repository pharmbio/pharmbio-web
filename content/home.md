#### Research focus: Intelligent systems with AI and machine learning in drug discovery and chemical safety

The Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group focuses on mathematical and statistical modeling, informatics and quantitative analysis of pharmacological systems. We develop methods, algorithms and software to study and model pharmaceutical interactions, and a key focus in the group is how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can aid the drug discovery process; e.g. in drug screening and when studying drug toxicity, metabolism and resistance. We combine in silico and in vitro experiments at the cellular level, and have access to a [robotized high-content imaging lab connected to a modern IT-infrastructure](/infrastructure/) to manage and analyze large-scale data. We are involved in several national and international consortia and have a tight connection to the pharmaceutical industry, Uppsala University Hospital, and Science for Life Laboratory. See the [Projects](https://pharmb.io/project/) page for more
information on our ongoing research projects.

We are an [interdisciplinary team of researchers](/people/) engaging in data-driven cell biology, aiming to develop autonomous biological laboratories where data drives decisions on what experiments should be done next, and where automation and AI modeling are core methodologies.
