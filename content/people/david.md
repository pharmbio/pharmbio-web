long_bio = "I am deeply fascinated by Artificial Intelligence-technology, and its applications within bioinformatics. I also have a long-standing history of messing with software, including being a self-taught Java-programmer at 12. Because of this, I have chosen to pursue a PhD at Uppsala University in Artificial Intelligence for *Analysis and Profiling of Morphological Features in High-Throughput Cell Images*. I am a graduate of Lund University with a Master of Science in Engineering Nanoscience, specializing in Bioinformatic Software Development and Biomedical Technology. "
