long_bio = "Graduated from the Evolutionary Biology Center in Uppsala while investigating the Y chromosomeâ€™s contribution to prenatal sex differences in the human brain. As a scientist at Dor Yeshorim, I worked on recessive mutation testing assays. Currently, I utilize cell painting methods to build cell morphology reference maps based on characterized compounds from the SPECS library. One of my favorite projects integrates cell painting with CRISPR technology in Progeria cells to facilitate high-throughput screening for novel drug repurposing candidates."
