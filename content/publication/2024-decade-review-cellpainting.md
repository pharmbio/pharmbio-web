abstract="Modern quantitative image analysis techniques have enabled high-throughput, high-content imaging experiments. Image-based profiling leverages the rich information in images to identify similarities or differences among biological samples, rather than measuring a few features, as in high-content screening. Here, we review a decade of advancements and applications of Cell Painting, a microscopy-based cell-labeling assay aiming to capture a cell’s state, introduced in 2013 to optimize and standardize image-based profiling. Cell Painting’s ability to capture cellular responses to various perturbations has expanded owing to improvements in the protocol, adaptations for different perturbations, and enhanced methodologies for feature extraction, quality control, and batch-effect correction. Cell Painting is a versatile tool that has been used in various applications, alone or with other -omics data, to decipher the mechanism of action of a compound, its toxicity profile, and other biological effects. Future advances will likely involve computational and experimental techniques, new publicly available datasets, and integration with other high-content data types."
