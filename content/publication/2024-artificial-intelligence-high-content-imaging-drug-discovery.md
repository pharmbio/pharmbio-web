abstract="Artificial intelligence (AI) and high-content imaging (HCI) are contributing to advancements in drug discovery, propelled by the recent progress in deep neural networks. This review highlights AI's role in analysis of HCI data from fixed and live-cell imaging, enabling novel label-free and multi-channel fluorescent screening methods, and improving compound profiling. HCI experiments are rapid and cost-effective, facilitating large data set accumulation for AI model training. However, the success of AI in drug discovery also depends on high-quality data, reproducible experiments, and robust validation to ensure model performance. Despite challenges like the need for annotated compounds and managing vast image data, AI's potential in phenotypic screening and drug profiling is significant. Future improvements in AI, including increased interpretability and integration of multiple modalities, are expected to solidify AI and HCI's role in drug discovery."
