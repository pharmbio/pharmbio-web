abstract = "Proper experimental design, including randomisation of experimental samples and conditions, can help reduce unwanted bias and control for potential plate or batch effects.
In this short presentation, we introduce the multiplate layout design problem, show how we modeled the problem using MiniZinc, and discuss some of our ongoing work and preliminary results."
